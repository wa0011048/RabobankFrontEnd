## Documentation

### Building your sources

`gulp build [--env=prod]`

* It copies all files from `src/` to `dist/` directory
* When used with prod env parameters, it applies all production transformations (minification, concatenation, ...)

### Serving your project

`gulp serve [--env=prod] [--watch [--no-livereload] [--tdd]]`

* This command build (like the previous command) files then serves them on `http://localhost:8888`
* `--watch` moves changed files to `dist/` directory and launches live reload (it cannot be used with `--env=prod` parameter)
* `--watch --no-livereload` same as the before but without live reload
* `--watch --tdd` same as before but lanches test units at each changes

### Testing your project

`gulp test:unit`

* Run unit tests

`gulp test:e2e [--env=prod]`

* Run functional tests. The site should be available on localhost:8888 before running this command.

_Note : Check the value of the seleniumJar in test/protractor.conf.js and verify that the version is the same that was downloaded._

You can use `npm run-script protactor-webdriver` to download the selenium server jar.
